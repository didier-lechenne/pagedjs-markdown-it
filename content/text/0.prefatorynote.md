PageTypeToPrint is a web + print layout and publishing tool. Originally designed as a template for formatting the thesis papers of the students of the _École supérieure d'art et de design des Pyrénes_, it focuses on the simplicity of editing process (textual content in markdown format), but can be adapted, expanded and customised. It produces content that can be read online in the form of a web page and generates a downloadable and printable PDF document. 

PageTypeToPrint is a tool that...

1. uses the PHP language,
2. to transform text in markdown format into an HTML page,
3. so that it can be displayed in a web browser,
4. and generate a printable PDF using Paged.js and the browser's internal functions.

PageTypeToPrint is free software. Its code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/esadpyrenees/PageTypeToPrint). The purpose of the following pages is to present the features and the main lines of the default choices made in the tool, from the point of view of editing a master's thesis.
